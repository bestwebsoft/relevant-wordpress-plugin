== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the other language files with the Related Posts Plugin? = 

Here is an example for Russian language files:
1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to set the WP version to the required language and in configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` write `define('WPLANG', 'ru_RU');`. If everything is done properly the admin panel will be in Russian.
2. Make sure that there are files `ru_RU.po` and `ru_RU.mo` in the plugin (the folder languages in the root of the plugin).
3. If there are no such files it will be necessary to copy other files from this folder (for example, for Italian language) and rename them (you should write `ru_RU` instead of `it_IT` in the both files).
4. The files are edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please load this program, install it, open the file with the help of this program (the required language file) and for each line in English you should write translation in Russian.
5. If everything is done properly all lines will be in Russian in the admin panel and in the frontend.
